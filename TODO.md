# Short term
- Resuming persistency mechanism (i.e. searcher cache)
- Re-indexing mechanism (i.e. @spawn worker, use incremental approach)
- Re-visit suggestion mechanism (too slow)
- Mechanism for query expansion

# Long term
- Data gathering: web crawler (either implement or support), data streaming sink APIs (should be in distinct support packages)
- Reliable search from any language to any language (external APIs?, dictionaries ?)
- Abstract semantic search (search into 1-D, 2-D signals i.e. sound, images)
- Ontology builder and explorer; (see [Conceptnet](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5)); arbitrary query to target ontology linking
- P2P
- [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) native embedding generation (i.e. custom embedding generation model architectures)
