# Introduction

Garamond is a search engine that supports both classical and semantic search. The documentation is work in progress and has little coverage right now.

## Installation

Installation can be performed in several ways.

### Git cloning
The `Garamond` repository can be downloaded through git:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zgornel/Garamond.jl
```

### Julia REPL
The repository can also be downloaded from inside Julia. Entering the Pkg mode with `]` and writing:
```
add https://github.com/zgornel/Garamond.jl#master
```
will download the `master` branch of the repository and add it to the current active development environment.

## Simple usage example
```@repl index
#TODO
```
